     HISTORY.DOC -- changes and bug-fixes made to PDQComm 2.00 and later


OPENCOM.ASM         9-17-90
Added code to call SETMEM automatically, so the user doesn't need to do that.
Also modified the code that takes over the communications interrupts to use
BASIC's B_OnExit routine. Also added RTS as a valid handshaking parameter
due to docs. Routine expected CTS.

C$TIME.ASM          9-17-90
New routine to measure elapsed time, used internally by OPENCOM.ASM.

C$CHKHND.ASM and COMPRINT.ASM   9-17-90
Fixed a bug that caused hardware handshaking to operate erratically.

CLOSECOM.ASM        9-19-90
CloseCom no longer sets ERR if the port wasn't open, to avoid a conflict with
regular QuickBASIC.

CRC16.ASM           9-19-90     BASIC 7 Far String Version
Fixed a far string bug that caused CRC16 not to work in the QBX environment.

COMLINP.ASM         9-21-90     BASIC 7 Far String Version
Rewrote ComLineInput due to erratic behavior of far string internals.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.01 ------------------------------^

SETHAND.ASM         10-23-90
Recognize "RTS" as well as "CTS".  Accidentally omitted when OpenCom was
fixed on 9-17.

FLUSHBUF.ASM        10-23-90
Added code to tell the remote terminal to resume sending if handshaking is in
use when called, so the programmer doesn't have to do that manually.

GLSTAT.ASM          10-23-90
New routine to retrieve the status of all four hardware lines at once.

PDQXMODM.BAS        10-23-90
Changed the variable named SeekLoc& to SeekLocation&, because SeekLoc& is
now a function name in P.D.Q.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.02 ------------------------------^

COMMBC7.QLB/LIB     10-29-90
Discovered that an old version of ComLineInput had inadvertently been placed
into these libraries.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.03 ------------------------------^

PDQCOMM 2.04        12-31-90
Last maintenance release of "one-port" version of PDQCOMM. Rewrote routines
so only 1 file is required for both near and far strings. To assemble for
far strings, use the /DFS switch along with the /DQLB switch. Fixed bugs
in the far string versions of ComInput$ and SetHand. PDQComm now restores
the state of the UART except for baud and the state of the 8259 PIC to the
values they had when OpenCom was used. XON/XOFF handshaking is now handeled
internally by ComPrint the same way CTS/RTS handshaking is.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.04 ------------------------------^

PDQCOMM 2.5       3/15/91
New library with new manual. See manual for differences from previous
versions.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.50 ------------------------------^

OPENCOM.ASM       5/1/91
Changed some error codes so they would reflect what was in the manual. Added
more error checking on the port parameters passed in.

OPENCOMX.ASM      5/1/91
Same changes as OPENCOM.

COMLINP.ASM       5/1/91
Fixed problem with excessive time out when no line feed is received. Program
will now wait .5 seconds for a linefeed.

SETCOM.ASM        5/1/91
Now checks Data Bits, Stop Bits, and Parity to see if they are in range.
Returns ERROR 5, Illegal Function Call, if parameters are bad.

D215DISP.BAS      5/1/91
Fixed problem with cursor when it was at a window boundary.

COMMDECL.BAS      5/1/91
The declaration for the Pause subroutine was left out. Added it.

PDQCOMM.ASM       5/1/91
File inadvertently included with source. Removed.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.51 ------------------------------^

CHECKSUM.ASM      9/1/91

Fixed same problem as above.

QB40BEXT.OBJ      9/1/91
Added stub file to add B_OnExit support for users of QB 4.0b. See the
comments in the README file for specifics on using this stub file.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.52 ------------------------------^

ISAPORT.ASM       9/9/91
New routine to check the existance of a serial port at a specified
address. See README for more info on this.

OPENCOM.ASM OPENCOMX.ASM SETCOM.ASM UARTTYPE.ASM   9/9/91
Modified to use ISAPORT routine.

Moved external declaration from .DATA? to .DATA

All ASM and INC files that begin with C$  9/9/91
Renamed all the C$ to C_ file names for compatibility with NMAKE.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.53 ------------------------------^
                                                                 
OPENCOMX.ASM      10/6/91
Fixed a bug introduced in version 2.53 on call to IsAPort.

COMLINP.ASM       10/6/91
Fixed the bug where ComLineInput didn't return ERROR 62 when the string being
returned is longer than 256 characters.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.54 ------------------------------^

TWOPORTS.ASM      12/30/91
Split up into C_COMISR.ASM and COMMDATA.ASM for future expansion of PDQCOMM,
and to allow four ports open on different IRQs.

ISAPORT.ASM       12/30/91
Added delay after putting UART into loopback mode for compatibility with
the Rockwell chip set.

UARTTYPE.ASM      12/30/91
Moved CLI command so it would function with the call to ISAPORT.

OPENCOM.ASM OPENCOMX.ASM CLOSECOM.ASM  12/30/91
Added support for "AT" IRQs.

PDQCOMM.RSP COMMQB4.RSP COMMBC7.RSP    12/30/91
Changed to reflect the new file names.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.55 ------------------------------^

OPENCOM.ASM and OPENCOMX.ASM    1/21/92
Fixed a bug that closed the port when it was mistakenly opened a second time.
Also fixed a bug that caused OpenCom to fail after trying to open a port that
does not exist.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.56 ------------------------------^

ISAPORT.ASM       2/19/92               
Changed the IsAPort routine to a more conventional one due to incompatible
modem chip sets.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.57 ------------------------------^

ISAPORT.ASM       5/7/92
Changed yet again so that it would work in a DOS box under Windows.

XMODEM.BAS        5/7/92
Replaced with XYMODEM.BAS.

XYMODEM.BAS       5/7/92
Added XModem-1K and YModem file transfer protocals. See README for info on
using these routines.

CLRXOFF.ASM       5/7/92
New routine that manually clears the XOFF flag to allow PDQComm to resume
tansmitting.

XXXDISP.BAS       5/7/92
Fixed a bug that added an extra linefeed when the line length was exactly
the number of maximum columns. Speeded up all routines by positioning
the cursor less frequently.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.58 ------------------------------^

GETPCON.ASM       9/14/92
Fixed a bug that caused GetPortConfig to return an invalid port error.

                  9/22/92
Added support for Visual Basic for DOS
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.59 ------------------------------^

XYMODEM.BAS       12/10/92
Added YModem-G. Cleaned up code considerably.

XXXXDISP.BAS      12/10/92
Fixed problems emulations had when running under Desqview.

COMPEEK.ASM       12/10/92
New routine that does a nondestructive read on the receive buffer.

COMINSTR.ASM      12/10/92
New routine that does an INSTR on the receive buffer.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.60 ------------------------------^

ANSIDISP.BAS      1/15/93
Mistakenly used MASM comments instead of BASIC comments. Now checks if using
the BIOS on ANSI clear screen sequences.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.61 ------------------------------^

C_TIME.ASM        4/27/93
Had a logic error that caused the elapsed time function to break at certain
times of the day.

ISAPORT.ASM       4/27/93
Yet another change. Added some delays when accessing the port to see if 
that solves a problem a few people still have with this function. A shot in
the dark since the old version worked fine on my 486DX2-50, but I'm running
out of ideas.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.62 ------------------------------^
 
ISAPORT.ASM
Yet another change.  Hopefully, this will make it 100% reliable.

XSTAT1.BAS
New and improved version that shows transfer progress with a "gas guage".
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.63 ------------------------------^

XSTAT1.BAS
Cleaned up and added to the header comments showing how the routine is called.

ANSITERM.BAS
Cleaned up the header comments showing how to compile and link the program.

FILESPEC.BAS
Removed references to the QB.BI include file which works only with QB 4.x,
and defined RegType in the program file proper so no include file is needed.

COMMDECL.BAS
Added a missing percent sign to the YModemGReceive function declaration, to
avoid the "Duplicate definition" error you'd get if DEFINT was not used in a
program that used this function.

XYMODEM.BAS
In the XYModemReceive function, BytesSent& = FileLen& was added at the code
labeled "Last block of data" to avoid an "Illegal function call" error in
XStat1 when sending certain-sized files.  Code was also added to close the
never-received file if the transfer was unsuccessful due to a timeout error.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.64 ------------------------------^

XYMODEM.BAS
In two places a test was added to ensure that small files sent in less than
a second don't create a "Divide by zero" error in the BytesPerSec calculation.
 ^------------------------------ Version 2.65 ------------------------------^
