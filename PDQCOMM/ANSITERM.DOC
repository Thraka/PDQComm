ANSITERM.BAS no longer requires P.D.Q. to compile or run. You can run
AnsiTerm in the QB, QBX, and VBDOS environment, but it will require you
to create a custom QuickLibrary. This is because AnsiTerm uses CALL INTERRUPT.
To create these QLBs, you need to do the following steps based on the
environment.

QuickBASIC 4.5

BASIC PDS 7.1

AnsiTerm determines the name of the currently running EXE to get the name
of its configuration file. When you run AnsiTerm in the environment, the
currently running EXE will be QB, QBX, or VBDOS. Therefore, Ansiterm will
create a configuration file called QB.CFG, QBX.CFG, or VBDOS.CFG.
